0.5k a week deficit
Metabolic adaptacion
-Les calories burn as weight loss happens continuosly
-2 account to it, you need to adapt the deficit or chill out

1.6-2.2g/kg
Caloric defict = 20%


*************************Miltiplier for TDEE*********************

Modern evidence-based adjustments (based on recent literature):
Use a more nuanced activity scale. Researchers now recommend a more granular and behavior-based estimate of daily activity.

For example:

True Activity Description	Realistic Multiplier
Very sedentary (desk job, no workouts)	1.3
Lightly active (desk job + light walking)	1.4–1.5
Moderately active (3–5 workouts/week, some NEAT)	1.6–1.7
Very active (daily intense training or active job)	1.8–1.9
Exceptionally active (manual labor + training)	2.0+

NEAT matters more than workouts.

Someone who gets 12k+ steps/day and trains 3x/week may burn more than someone who sits all day but trains hard 6x/week.

Multipliers should reflect entire day movement, not just gym sessions.

Many people overestimate their activity.

A person who "trains hard 1 hour/day" but is otherwise sedentary is often closer to 1.4–1.6, not 1.7–1.9.

Use a step counter or wearable to help gauge NEAT and adjust accordingly.

Keep dietary fat above 0.8 g/kg to maintain hormones

****Como saber esto?****
How long have you been resistance training consistently (3+ times/week)?

| Training Duration     | Strength Progression                            | Training Approach |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| <6 mo                 | Rapid weekly gains                              | Beginner          |
| 6 mo–2 yrs            | Gains slower, needs structure                   | Intermediate      |
| ≥2 yrs                | Little weekly gains, needs advanced programming | Advanced          |
| Any duration, BF high | Adjust separately (Endomorph case)              | Special approach  |


Are you still making regular strength gains each week or every few sessions?
If yes, you're likely intermediate or advanced. If not, you're likely a beginner.
