-Les calories burn as weight loss happens continuosly
-2 account to it, you need to adapt the deficit or chill out

1.6-2.2g/kg
Caloric defict = 20%


*************************Miltiplier for TDEE*********************

Modern evidence-based adjustments (based on recent literature):
Use a more nuanced activity scale. Researchers now recommend a more granular and behavior-based estimate of daily activity.

For example:

True Activity Description	Realistic Multiplier
Very sedentary (desk job, no workouts)	1.3
Lightly active (desk job + light walking)	1.4–1.5
Moderately active (3–5 workouts/week, some NEAT)	1.6–1.7
Very active (daily intense training or active job)	1.8–1.9
Exceptionally active (manual labor + training)	2.0+

NEAT matters more than workouts.

Someone who gets 12k+ steps/day and trains 3x/week may burn more than someone who sits all day but trains hard 6x/week.

Multipliers should reflect entire day movement, not just gym sessions.

Many people overestimate their activity.

A person who "trains hard 1 hour/day" but is otherwise sedentary is often closer to 1.4–1.6, not 1.7–1.9.

Use a step counter or wearable to help gauge NEAT and adjust accordingly.

| Goal/Body Type                       | Recommended Deficit       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Overweight / High BF% (>25%)**     | 20–25%                    |
| **Moderate BF% (15–25%)**            | 15–20%                    |
| **Lean (cutting, <15% BF)**          | 10–15% (or less)          |
| **Aggressive mini-cut (short-term)** | Up to 30% (not long-term) |
